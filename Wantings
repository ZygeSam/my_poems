Like a ghost in a  dark room
I love to sit around and watch you
Observing the way you create the world around you

I want to be around you
Within your touch and cuddles
I want to ride with you in your saddles

Please do not chase me with a ladle
But encourage me to paddle
It's not my fault love is a battle
