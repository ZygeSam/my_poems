To go through the eye of a needle

You must be very subtle
You've got to do a quick paddle
Though you may enter into a poodle
Because, in life, you have to hustle
Everywhere, manage the bustle
Sometimes you feel the need for a cuddle
Right now is not the time to feel like a baby in a cradle
You must jump and saddle
