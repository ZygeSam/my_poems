*Wild thoughts*
*AUTHOR: ZYGE* Corrected**

Watching you sway to the music
Made me fight with my thoughts of being a cleric
The twisting and twerking
So sharp as a razors cutting
With jubilation in your eyes
You synchronized celebration in disguise


The hypnotizing effect of your hips
Threw a captivating spell on me 
With my heart beating fast
And my thoughts racing wild
My yearnings grew
I feel my dreams come true
I felt a fresh dew 
While drawing closer to you
My hand magnetized to your waist
All I could think about and what I could say
Is I love you
